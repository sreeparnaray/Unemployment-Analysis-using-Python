# Unemployment Analysis using Python
The aim of this project is to analysis the unemployment during COVID-19 pandemic using machine learning techniques. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and containment responses have exposed existing social, economic, gender, ethnic and health inequities and are rapidly exacerbating these. The higher risks of infection and mortality recorded for specific population groups can be traced to a legacy of cumulative inequities in the social determinants of health (SDH). Additionally, the necessary COVID-19 response measures applied, while helping to reduce infection and mortality, have placed a disproportionate burden on more disadvantaged populations, widening health inequities.
